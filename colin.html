I live in Vancouver, graduated with a degree in Political Science and Environment Scient. Gaming is a hobby of mines; particularly playing RTS MOBA like League of Legends and Dota. I am taking this course to use the knowledge I learn to apply to make new website and maybe even apps for the League commmunity.
